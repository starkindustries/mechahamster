================

### Overview

MechaHamster uses [Firebase Crashlytics (Beta)][] to capture in
app crashes, so that developers can more easily diagnose issues
and prioritize fixes.

### Code Locations


When the game is launched, the MainGame.StartGame state
(`Assets/Hamster/Scripts/MainGame.cs`) initializes Crashltyics
by accessing FirebaseApp.DefaultInstance. The instantiation of the
DefaultInstance will automatically start the platform level SDK in
Android or iOS.

One can manually trigger a crash in the game by navigating to the
SettingsMenu and clicking the `Self Destruct!` button three times. This will
throw one of six exceptions and exercise many of the Crashlytics APIs
like logging a message, capturing the user's id (if logged in), and
adding a custom key/value pair for context.

The code for the SelfDestruct functionality lives largely in:

* the MeltdownMenu
(`Assets/Hamster/Scripts/States/MeltdownMenu.cs`)
* the SelfDestructMenu
(`Assets/Hamster/Scripts/States/SelfDestructMenu.cs`)
* the PseudoRandomExceptionChooser
(`Assets/Hamster/Scripts/States/Exceptions/PseudoRandomExceptionChooser.cs`).
